For introduction to matrix factorization in context of recommender systems see [this piece from IEEE](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E4903/papers/ieeecomputer.pdf).

Probabilistic interpretation of penalty in matrix factorization can be found in [Probabilistic Matrix Factorization](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/pmf.pdf).

[Here](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf) you can find the original GLRM paper.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages (I've checked with 3.5)
* jupyter-notebook
* numpy
* pandas
* h2o

Note that first three packages are by default available in Anaconda.
